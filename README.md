# Advent of Code
My attempts at puzzles of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Installation
To run the code, you need to have Python (3.10.4 or higher) installed. To clone the repository, create a virtual environment and install all the necessary packages, you could for example run the following code in Git Bash:
`git clone https://github.com/oThommy/advent-of-code.git && cd advent-of-code && python -m venv venv && source venv/Scripts/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
